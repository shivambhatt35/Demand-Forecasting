# Demand Forecasting with Time-Series Analysis

A **robust, modular pipeline** for **hourly demand prediction** leveraging time-series analysis and machine learning. Designed to optimize **inventory management**, **supply chain operations**, and **logistics forecasting** by generating highly granular, accurate forecasts.

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **comprehensive time-series forecasting framework** to predict hourly demand across warehouses and delivery zones. By combining historical order data, product availability, and temporal feature engineering, it generates predictions that help businesses improve operational efficiency, reduce stockouts, and plan deliveries effectively.

The solution transforms raw transactional and inventory snapshot data into an enriched dataset containing:  

- **Temporal features:** Hour-of-day, day-of-week, weekend indicators  
- **Lag-based historical demand:** Captures autocorrelation and short-term trends  
- **Availability mapping:** Links product stock levels to delivery polygons  

This framework ensures that downstream **machine learning models or statistical forecasting methods** can **capture patterns, trends, and seasonal effects** with high accuracy.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hourly Forecasting** | Aggregates order counts at an hourly granularity for each warehouse and delivery polygon. |
| **Dense Time Grid** | Generates a complete hourly grid with zero-filled missing slots for consistent time series. |
| **Feature Enrichment** | Temporal features like `weekend flags`, cyclical `hour-of-day` features, and holiday indicators. |
| **Lag Features** | Computes lagged order counts (e.g., t-1, t-2, t-3) to capture autocorrelation and trends. |
| **Availability & Geo Mapping** | Integrates product availability with delivery zone data for accurate local demand forecasting. |
| **Flexible Integration** | Connects seamlessly with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and ETL pipelines. |
| **Missing Data Handling** | Ensures complete datasets with filled missing orders and lag features for robust modeling. |

## Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
- Pull historical order and product availability data from relational databases.
- Filter data by date ranges and warehouses/polygons.

### 2. Data Aggregation
- Aggregate orders by `warehouse`, `polygon`, `date`, and `hour`.
- Summarize product availability per time slot.

### 3. Dense Grid Creation
- Generate all possible combinations of hour-warehouse-polygon.
- Fill missing slots with `0` to maintain continuous time series.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- **Temporal features:** `is_weekend`, `day-of-week`, cyclical encoding (`sin(hour)`, `cos(hour)`)  
- **Lag features:** Capture recent order trends (Lag-1, Lag-2, Lag-3)

### 5. Dataset Preparation
- Merge availability data with aggregated orders.
- Output a clean, fully structured dataset ready for **ML model training or statistical forecasting**.
